# Zettelkasten


## 简介

一个为了迎合我个人笔记习惯而写的简单obisidian插件，以后会逐渐尝试完善。
我希望每个随手记录的卡片都可以被归档到不同的线路下，也就是说多个线路可以引用同一个卡片，这样回顾起来就更方便。

**下一步计划加入一些更便捷的模块，重新排版我的obisidian面板，让卡片可以像炉石构建新卡组一样从归档资源中自由拖动，你可以仅仅通过编排自己过往收集的零碎知识点，就可以轻松组合出一篇丰满的文章。**

当我连续三次忘记c++中`accumulate`函数第四个参数的要求时，我想，我必须找到一个地方，能够记录这样小小一行句子，而不用每次都去查资料。而当我有了足够多的小句子小文段，我想，我必须把它们组织起来。

我认为这是极其符合我个人习惯的笔记方式。过去我尝试了很多不同人的笔记方法，直到想出来这个方法（后来才知道Zettelkasten也在使用这样的方法，只不过他更原始而古早），我才得以我把每天接触到的海量不同领域的知识，以及在接触知识时产生的感悟结合起来。

## Introduction

This is a simple Obsidian plugin written to cater to my personal note-taking habits, and I will gradually try to improve it over time.  
I hope every casually recorded note can be archived under different categories, meaning multiple categories can reference the same note, making it more convenient to review later.

**The next step is to add some more convenient modules, reformat my Obsidian dashboard, and allow notes to be freely dragged from the archive resources like building a new deck in Hearthstone. By organizing the scattered bits of knowledge I've collected in the past, you can easily combine them into a well-rounded article.**

When I repeatedly forgot the requirement of the fourth parameter in C++'s `accumulate` function three times, I thought to myself, I need to find a place where I can record such small pieces of information, without having to look it up every time. And when I have enough of these little sentences and snippets, I realized I need to organize them.

I believe this note-taking method aligns perfectly with my personal habits. In the past, I tried many different note-taking methods from various people, until I came up with this approach (which I later learned is also used in the Zettelkasten method, though in a more primitive form). This method allows me to combine the vast amounts of knowledge I encounter daily across different fields with the insights I gain while learning.
